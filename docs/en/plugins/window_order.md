# Window Order Plugin

The Window Order plugin automatically reorders windows in a workspace based on configured priority weights, with larger values positioned further to the left.

## Configuration

```toml
[piri.plugins]
window_order = true

[piri.window_order]
enable_event_listener = true  # Enable event listening for automatic reordering
default_weight = 0            # Default weight for unconfigured windows
# workspaces = ["1", "2@DP-1", "dev@eDP-1"]  # Optional: only apply to specific workspaces (empty = all)

[window_order]
google-chrome = 100
code = 80
ghostty = 70
```

### Configuration Options

- `enable_event_listener`: Whether to enable event listening. When enabled, windows are automatically reordered when layout changes or new windows open (only works in configured `workspaces`)
- `default_weight`: Default weight value for windows not configured in `[window_order]`
- `workspaces`: Optional, specify which workspaces to apply window ordering. Can be workspace names, indices, or `name@output` format (array of strings). If empty or not specified, applies to all workspaces
- `[window_order]`: Window weight configuration table, where keys are window `app_id` and values are weights (larger values go to the left)

### Weight Matching Rules

The plugin supports partial matching:

- Config `ghostty = 70` can match `com.mitchellh.ghostty`
- Config `google-chrome = 100` can match `google-chrome-stable`

Matching priority:

1. Exact match
2. Config key is contained in `app_id`
3. `app_id` is contained in config key
4. If no match, use `default_weight`

## Usage

### Manual Trigger

```bash
piri window_order toggle
```

**Note**: Manual trigger works in any workspace, regardless of `workspaces` configuration.

### Automatic Trigger

If `enable_event_listener` is enabled, the plugin automatically reorders windows when:

- Window layout changes (`WindowLayoutsChanged` event)
- New window opens (`WindowOpenedOrChanged` event)

**Note**: Automatic trigger only works in workspaces specified in the `workspaces` configuration. If `workspaces` is not configured or empty, applies to all workspaces.

## How It Works

The plugin uses an intelligent algorithm to minimize the number of window moves:

1. Get column positions of all tiled windows in the current workspace
2. Calculate target position for each window based on configured weights
3. Use a greedy algorithm to find the solution with minimum moves
4. Move windows to target positions sequentially

### Algorithm Features

- **Minimize Moves**: Prefer moves that get the most windows to correct positions
- **Minimize Distance**: Among moves with the same move count, choose the one with minimum distance
- **Prefer Focused Window**: If only one move is needed, prefer moving the currently focused window
- **Preserve Relative Order**: Windows with the same weight maintain their current relative order

## Features

- ✅ **Smart Sorting**: Automatically sort windows based on configured weights
- ✅ **Minimize Moves**: Use optimized algorithm to reduce the number of window moves
- ✅ **Partial Matching**: Support partial matching of `app_id`
- ✅ **Event-Driven**: Optional automatic reordering feature
- ✅ **Focus Preservation**: Restore original focused window after moves
- ✅ **Stable Sort**: Windows with the same weight maintain relative order

## Use Cases

- Keep frequently used applications (browser, editor) fixed on the left side of the workspace
- Maintain relative order when multiple windows of the same application exist
- Automatically maintain window order through event listening

## Notes

1. **Tiled Windows Only**: Floating windows are not reordered
2. **Workspace Filtering**:
   - **Manual Trigger**: Works in any workspace, regardless of `workspaces` configuration
   - **Automatic Trigger**: Only works in workspaces specified in `workspaces` configuration. If not configured or empty, applies to all workspaces
3. **Larger Weight = Left**: A window with weight 100 will be to the left of a window with weight 80
4. **Same Weight Preserves Order**: Windows with the same weight don't change relative order to reduce unnecessary moves
5. **Workspace Matching**: `workspaces` supports workspace names, indices, or `workspace@output` format (as strings), e.g., `["1", "2@DP-1", "dev@eDP-1"]`. The `@output` part supports display prefix matching (`"2@DP"` matches `DP-1`, `DP-2`, etc.)
