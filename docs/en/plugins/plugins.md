# Plugin System

Piri supports a plugin system that allows you to extend functionality. Plugins run automatically in daemon mode.

## Available Plugins

### [Scratchpads](scratchpads.md)

A powerful window management feature that allows you to quickly show and hide windows of frequently used applications. Supports cross-workspace and cross-monitor functionality.

**Key Features**:
- Quick show/hide of frequently used applications
- Cross-workspace and cross-monitor support
- Customizable appearance direction and size

### [Empty Plugin](empty.md)

Executes commands when switching to specific empty workspaces. Useful for automating workflows, such as automatically launching applications in empty workspaces.

**Key Features**:
- Automatic command execution on empty workspaces
- Workspace-based configuration
- Similar to Hyprland's `on-created-empty` workspace rule

### [Window Rule Plugin](window_rule.md)

Automatically moves windows to specified workspaces based on their `app_id` or `title`. Useful for automating window management and organizing applications.

**Key Features**:
- Automatic window assignment to workspaces
- Match by `app_id` or `title` (with regex support)
- Similar to Hyprland's window rules

### [Autofill Plugin](autofill.md)

Automatically aligns the last column of windows to the rightmost position when windows are closed or layout changes. Helps maintain a clean and organized window layout.

**Key Features**:
- Pure event-driven, real-time alignment
- Zero configuration required
- Focus preservation - maintains user's focused window
- Workspace-aware operation

### [Sleepy Plugin](sleepy.md)

Reports focused app status to a Sleepy server on focus changes, useful for online presence and device status sync.

**Key Features**:
- Event-driven reporting (triggered by focus changes)
- Supports both Bearer token and secret-based auth flows
- Built-in status deduplication to avoid redundant requests

## Plugin Control

You can control which plugins are enabled or disabled in the configuration file:

```toml
[piri.plugins]
scratchpads = true
empty = true
window_rule = true
autofill = true
```

**Default Behavior**:
- If not explicitly specified, plugins are **disabled** by default (`false`)
- You must explicitly set `scratchpads = true`, `empty = true`, `window_rule = true`, or `autofill = true` to enable plugins
- Exception: `window_rule` plugin is enabled by default if window rules are configured (unless explicitly set to `false`)
