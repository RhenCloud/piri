# Window Rule Plugin

The Window Rule plugin automatically moves windows to specified workspaces based on their `app_id` or `title` using regular expression matching.

## Configuration

Use the `[[window_rule]]` format to configure window rules:

```toml
[piri.plugins]
window_rule = true

# Match by app_id
[[window_rule]]
app_id = "ghostty"
open_on_workspace = "1"

# Match by title
[[window_rule]]
title = ".*Chrome.*"
open_on_workspace = "browser"
focus_command = "notify-send 'Focusing on Chrome'"

# Specify both app_id and title (either match works)
[[window_rule]]
app_id = "code"
title = ".*VS Code.*"
open_on_workspace = "dev"

# Only focus_command, don't move window
[[window_rule]]
title = ".*Chrome.*"
focus_command = "notify-send 'Chrome focused'"

# Execute focus_command only once per rule (rule-level, not window-level)
[[window_rule]]
app_id = "firefox"
focus_command = "notify-send 'Firefox focused'"
focus_command_once = true

# Regex example: match app_id starting with "firefox"
[[window_rule]]
app_id = "^firefox"
open_on_workspace = "2"

# Match exact app_id
[[window_rule]]
app_id = "^code$"
open_on_workspace = "dev"

# app_id as a list (any one matches)
[[window_rule]]
app_id = ["code", "code-oss", "codium"]
open_on_workspace = "dev"

# title as a list (any one matches)
[[window_rule]]
title = [".*Chrome.*", ".*Chromium.*", ".*Google Chrome.*"]
open_on_workspace = "browser"
```

## Configuration Fields

- **`app_id`** (optional): Regular expression pattern(s) to match window `app_id`. Can be a string or a list of strings. If a list is provided, any pattern that matches will trigger the rule.
- **`title`** (optional): Regular expression pattern(s) to match window title. Can be a string or a list of strings. If a list is provided, any pattern that matches will trigger the rule.
- **`open_on_workspace`** (optional): Target workspace identifier (name or index), supports `workspace@output` format for specifying a monitor. Append `!` to lock the window to that workspace (e.g., `"1@eDP!"`)
- **`focus_command`** (optional): Command to execute when the window gains focus
- **`focus_command_once`** (optional, default: `false`): If set to `true`, the `focus_command` will only execute once globally for the rule, regardless of how many windows match it. See [issue #1](https://github.com/Asthestarsfalll/piri/issues/1) for more details.

**Note**:
- At least one of `app_id` or `title` must be specified
- At least one of `open_on_workspace` or `focus_command` must be specified
- If both `app_id` and `title` are specified, either match works (OR logic)
- `app_id` and `title` can be either a single string or a list of strings. When a list is provided, any pattern in the list that matches will trigger the rule

## Workspace Identifiers

Supports two types:

- **name**: Workspace name, e.g., `"main"`, `"browser"`
- **idx**: Workspace index (1-based), e.g., `"1"`, `"2"`

**Matching Order**: Name first, then idx.

### Monitor-Specific Matching

Use the `workspace@output` format to move windows to a workspace on a specific output:

```toml
# Move to workspace "2" on output "DP-1"
[[window_rule]]
app_id = "firefox"
open_on_workspace = "2@DP-1"

# Move to workspace "browser" on output "eDP-1"
[[window_rule]]
app_id = "chrome"
open_on_workspace = "browser@eDP-1"
```

## How It Works

The plugin listens for `WindowOpened` events:

1. Uses configured regular expressions to match window `app_id` or `title`
2. If matched, automatically moves the window to the specified workspace
3. Rules are checked in configuration order, **the first matching rule is applied**
4. If `open_on_workspace` ends with `!`, the window is locked to that workspace

### Workspace Locking

Append `!` to `open_on_workspace` to lock the window to the specified workspace, preventing it from being moved away manually:

```toml
# Lock to workspace 1 (eDP monitor)
[[window_rule]]
app_id = "firefox"
open_on_workspace = "1@eDP!"

# Lock to workspace named "dev"
[[window_rule]]
app_id = "^code$"
open_on_workspace = "dev!"
```

Locked windows are checked on every attribute change; if they are not on the target workspace, they are automatically moved back.

## Features

- ✅ **Regular Expressions**: Supports full regular expression syntax
- ✅ **Flexible Matching**: Supports `app_id` or `title`, or both combined (OR logic)
- ✅ **List Support**: `app_id` and `title` can be lists of patterns, any one match triggers the rule
- ✅ **Regex Caching**: Compiled regular expressions are cached for better performance
- ✅ **Workspace Locking** (`!` suffix): Prevents windows from being moved away
- ✅ **Hot Config Reload**: Supports configuration updates without restarting the daemon

## focus_command_once Feature

The `focus_command_once` option allows you to execute `focus_command` only once per rule, rather than once per window. This is particularly useful for applications that:

- Create temporary or initial windows with generic titles (e.g., Firefox's initial window titled "Mozilla Firefox")
- Spawn multiple child windows where you only want to execute the command on the first match
- Use applications like Wolfram Mathematica that create windows that should be properly floated before reaching the main interface

**How it works**: When `focus_command_once = true`, the `focus_command` is executed only the first time any window matches the rule. Subsequent windows matching the same rule will not trigger the command again. The tracking is at the rule level, meaning different windows matching the same rule will all share the same execution status.

**Example use case**: See [issue #1](https://github.com/Asthestarsfalll/piri/issues/1).

## Notes

1. **Rule Order Matters**: The first matching rule is applied, subsequent rules are not checked
2. **Non-existent Workspace**: If the specified workspace doesn't exist, a warning is logged but no error is raised
3. **Regex Performance**: Recommend using simple and clear patterns for better performance
4. **focus_command_once is Rule-level**: The tracking is per rule, not per window. Once a rule's `focus_command` has been executed (when `focus_command_once = true`), it won't execute again for any subsequent windows matching that rule
